# ObsConfigGenerator

Commands needed to implement

- Single/default command to download any prerecorded sets, generate our scene
  collection, and move them into the OBS folder.
  - Create any appdata folders that are needed
  - Any old scene collections are moved to archives
  - Any old sets are removed, so we should probably keep them in folders by
    event date

- Open the appdata s4vr folder
- Open the expected OBS scene collection folder

# Things we have yet to implement

- Convert google drive direct link
- Convert dropbox link
- YTDLP for youtube
- Predownload prerecords and store them in our appdata
- Build into a binary in GHA and distribute
- Audio Only Sets
